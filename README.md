[Google Cloud Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/) is Google's NoSQL
Big Data database service. It's the same database that powers many core Google
services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail.

Bigtable is designed to handle massive workloads at consistent low latency and
high throughput, so it's a great choice for both operational and analytical
applications, including IoT, user analytics, and financial data analysis.

Bigtable provisions and scales to hundreds of petabytes automatically, and can
smoothly handle millions of operations per second. Changes to the deployment
configuration are immediate, so there is no downtime during reconfiguration.

Bigtable [integrates easily][integrations] with popular Big Data tools like
Hadoop, as well as Google Cloud Platform products like Cloud Dataflow and
Dataproc. Plus, Bigtable supports the open-source, industry-standard HBase API,
which makes it easy for development teams to get started.

## Project setup, installation, and configuration

### Prerequisites

* [Create a Cloud Bigtable instance](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/creating-instance)
* **Recommended**: [Install the Google Cloud SDK for Cloud Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/installing-cloud-sdk)

### Using the Java client

* Add the appropriate [Cloud Bigtable artifact dependencies](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.cloud.bigtable) to your [Maven project](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/using-maven).
  * bigtable-hbase-1.x: use for standalone applications where you are in control your dependencies.
  * bigtable-hbase-1.x-hadoop: use in hadoop environments
  * bigtable-hbase-1.x-shaded: use in environments (other than hadoop) that require older versions of protobuf, guava, etc.  
  * bigtable-hbase-2.x: use for standalone applications where you are in control your dependencies.  This includes an HBase async client.
  * bigtable-hbase-2.x-hadoop: use in hadoop environments
  * bigtable-hbase-2.x-shaded: use in environments (other than hadoop) that require older versions of protobuf, guava, etc.  

* Example:
   ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.cloud.bigtable</groupId>
        <artifactId>bigtable-hbase-1.x</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
  ```

* Refer to the [Java samples documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/samples) for detailed demonstrations of how to read and write data with Cloud Bigtable. The code for these samples is available in the [Cloud Bigtable examples project](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-bigtable-examples).

## Questions and discussions

If you have questions or run into issues with Google Cloud Bigtable or the
client libraries, you can use any of the following forums:

* Stack Overflow: tag questions with [`google-cloud-bigtable`][stackoverflow-link]
* Mailing list: [google-cloud-bigtable-discuss@][google-cloud-bigtable-discuss]

You can also subscribe to
[google-cloud-bigtable-announce@][google-cloud-bigtable-announce] list to receive
infrequent product and client library announcements.

## Developing and testing

1. Running `mvn clean install` will build and install Cloud Bigtable client artifacts to your local repository, and then run the unit tests.
2. There is also a suite of integration tests that connect to a cluster you have access to via the authentication credentials that were loaded via the Google Cloud SDK configuration step (see above).

   Use the following command to run the Cloud Bigtable integration tests for HBase 1:

   ```sh
   mvn clean integration-test \
       -PbigtableIntegrationTest \
       -Dgoogle.bigtable.project.id=[your cloud project id] \
       -Dgoogle.bigtable.instance.id=[your cloud bigtable instance id]
   ```

   Use the following command to run the Cloud Bigtable integration tests for HBase 2:

   ```sh
   mvn clean integration-test \
       -PbigtableIntegrationTestH2 \
       -Dgoogle.bigtable.project.id=[your cloud project id] \
       -Dgoogle.bigtable.instance.id=[your cloud bigtable instance id]
   ```
   
   There are also tests that perform compatibility tests against an HBase Minicluster, which can be invoked with the following commands for HBase 1 and HBase 2 respectively: 
   ```sh
   mvn clean integration-test -PhbaseLocalMiniClusterTest
   ```
   ```sh
   mvn clean integration-test -PhbaseLocalMiniClusterTestH2
   ```


   You can run those commands at the top of the project, or you can run then at the appropriate integration-tests project.  
   
   Developer's NOTE: You can build the project faster by running the following command, and then run the integration test command from the appropriate integration test directory:
   
   ```sh
   mvn -pl bigtable-hbase-parent/bigtable-hbase-1.x-integration-tests \
   -pl bigtable-hbase-2.x-parent/bigtable-hbase-2.x-integration-tests \
   -am clean package
   ```

NOTE: This project uses extensive shading which IDEs have trouble with. To over come these issues,
you can disable the `with-shaded` profile in your IDE to force it to resolve the dependencies from your local
maven repository. When you disable that profile, you have to attach workspace sources to local maven repository jars.
